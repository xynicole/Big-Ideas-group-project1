This python program is for people to check what letter of an index in their name. 

Basically, it asks the user to enter their name and the index they want to check, and then output the letter of that index. It will print an error statement when people enter non-number in the index box. Also, it will catch runtime error when people enter any number larger than the name length or less than 1 in the index box.
